React has a slim API, a robust and evolving ecosystem and a great community. In this course we will be learning React by creating various projects.If you want to learn more than just same old tutorial and instead create interesting projects using React.js this course is for you. During the course we will also cover redux-toolkit, which is the latest flavor of good old redux and build an interesting project with it. After each tutorial section we will build few projects to put see theory in action. You are not expected to build all projects, but the more course projects, you will complete the easier it's going to be to build your own applications, since you will know how to implement certain features in react.",
